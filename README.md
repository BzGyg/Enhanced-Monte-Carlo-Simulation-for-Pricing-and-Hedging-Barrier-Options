# Enhanced-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Pricing-and-Hedging-Barrier-Options
## Introduction
Monte Carlo simulation is common for pricing options and assessing their price sensitivities. However, it is susceptible to two drawbacks: slow convergence rates and the time discretization. The latter problem usually leads to extra bias when simulating path-dependent processes such as Barrier options pricing. 

In our project, we addressed the bias resulting from time discretization in Barrier options pricing by leveraging the reflection principle. We then applied the insights gained from the previous section, combined with smoothing techniques, to analyze the Delta hedge of Barrier options.
